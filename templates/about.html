    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Hey there, I'm Khue! I'm a Site Reliability Engineer. I have a wide
        range of interests in technology that I love to explore and tinker
        with.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in high school, my dad gave me his old laptop and showed me
        Linux. I was instantly hooked and spent countless hours customizing it
        to my liking, fixing many issues, trying different distros, building my
        own themes, and building Linux From Scratch. Those experiences were
        super fun and ended up paving the way for my career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from work, I enjoy staying active through calisthenics and
        swimming. I'm also an avid gamer and enjoy playing a variety of games
        such as Overwatch, Elden Ring and Hades. I play all my games on Linux,
        thanks to Wine and Proton.
