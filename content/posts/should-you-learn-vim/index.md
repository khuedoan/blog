Vim is a non-conventional text editor and will take a lot of time to learn.
But is it worth learning?

There are two parts:

- Vim key bindings
- Vim: the text editor

## Vim key bindings

Yes. You learn it once and use it everywhere.

Almost every single text editor and IDE have a Vim mode, so you don't have to relearn the keyboard shortcuts every time you change your IDE (and let's be real you *will* change your editor from time to time, unless you already using vim/neovim or emacs).

For example IntelliJ has IdeaVim, VS Code has the Vim plugin or Neovim plugin.

## Vim the text editor

Maybe, maybe not. Consider the following:

- You enjoy the process of optimizing your text editor
- You *really* care about the performance and responsiveness
- You want an editor that tailored exactly to your needs and preferences

If you care more about the customization than performance, you might want to look at Emacs and evil mode.

## Summary

So, learn vim keybindings is always worth it, and learn the editor if you have time or interest.
