Currently I have use multiple Git services:

- [GitHub](github.com), mainly for discovery and showing off my projects.
- My private [Gitea](https://gitea.com) Git server at
  [git.khuedoan.com](git.khuedoan.com) hosted on my first Kubernetes cluster (you can't access this server, it's only
  available in my internal network).
- My public [Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) Git
  server at [code.khuedoan.com](code.khuedoan.com) hosted on second Kubernetes cluster.
- Another private [Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) Git
  server to mirror everything from the above, and other open-source projects that
  I'm interested in preserving [git-mirror.khuedoan.com](git-mirror.khuedoan.com) hosted on my third Kubernetes cluster
  (you also can't access this server).

While git itself is distributed and this is (probably) how it should be used,
managing all of them is kinda annoying:

- I have to add multiple push URLs to my repos, so that it will push to all of
  my servers when I run `git push`.
- I have to setup cron jobs on some of my servers to mirror them from another
  servers, which occationally has conflict because I develop and push to multiple
  ones, especially when collaborate with other contributors that sends patches
  to my repositories on GitHub.

If only there's a way to make my Git servers peer-to-peer and I only have to manage a single remote ðŸ¤”
