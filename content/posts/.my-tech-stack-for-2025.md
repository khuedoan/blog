Infra:

- Bare metal by default, cloud for cost & availability, Cloudflare for DNS
- Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning, with wrapper modules for cloud-agnostic setup
- NixOS for compute nodes, installed with nixos-install in Pulumi

Platform:

- Kubernetes/k3s for compute orchestration and networking
- LGTM for observability, ntfy.sh to receive notification on phone
- Zot to store all artifacts as OCI images (app container images + manifests)
- Radicle as the fully distributed Git forge
- Custom application development platform built with Kubernetes and Temporal to abstract all of the above

Apps:

- Docker compose for local dev servers
- Rust for backend
- For database, use SQlite by default, and PostgreSQL for things that needs high availability
- HTMX for frontend, with basic styling with PicoCSS
- Nix to manage development dependencies and CI/CD definition, runs on the above custom platform
