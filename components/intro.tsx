        Welcome to my website! If you&apos;re looking to connect with me on
        social media, you&apos;ll find all the links you need below. And while
        you&apos;re here, feel free to check out some of my latest projects or
        swing by the blog where I ramble about all things Linux, DevOps,
        homelab, and workflow optimization (and anything else that catches my
        fancy, really).
